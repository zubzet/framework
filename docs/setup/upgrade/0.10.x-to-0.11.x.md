## Installation

### Application entry
A `main,php` file does no longer exist. The entry file has changed and needs to include the following now.:
``` PHP
require_once "vendor/autoload.php";

// ZubZet Initialization
$app = new Zubzet\Core(root: __DIR__);
$app->execute();
```

### Class name changes
The class `z_framework` is now called `Core`. If you use typed parameters referencing this class, they have to be removed or updated.

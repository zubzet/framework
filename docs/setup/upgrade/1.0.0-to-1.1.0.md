## New Features

### Access Control

ZubZet now includes significantly enhanced [**access control and permission capabilities**](../../../core-features/access-control).
This update introduces improved developer ergonomics, support for **user-based permissions**, and a more flexible and extensible authorization workflow.


### Migration System

A new [**migration system**](../../../core-features/migrations) has been added.
It enables developers to easily create and manage database migrations and seed data, as well as handle environments and migration execution in a structured and consistent manner.


### Global Helper Functions

To simplify development and reduce boilerplate, a set of [**global helper functions**](../../../core-features/global-helper-functions) is now available.
These helpers provide more convenient access to application objects and services.


### Console

ZubZet can now be managed more efficiently through [**console commands**](../../../core-features/console-commands).
This allows for improved automation, maintenance, and development workflows.


## Other Changes

### File Structure

The project file structure has been revised to improve **maintainability, clarity, and scalability**.
Several directories and files have been reorganized to better reflect their responsibilities.

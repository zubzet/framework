## Migrating version 0.9 to 0.10
The update system has been changed. Before upgrading to 0.11.x, please run the legacy updater one last time using the Admin Dashboard or by running the command `php z_framework/updater.php` in the root directory of your project.

Make sure that you have pulled the latest version of 0.10.x before running the legacy updater.

### Repository URL
The repository URL has changed. ZubZet now made it to Github! To update your submodule, run the following command in the z_framework folder.

=== "SSH"
    Update to the new repo URL using SSH:
    ```bash
    git submodule set-url z_framework ssh://git@github.com:zubzet/framework.git
    ```
=== "HTTPS"
    Update to the new repo URL using HTTPS:
    ```bash
    git submodule set-url z_framework https://github.com/zubzet/framework.git
    ```

Be sure to checkout to 0.11.0 afterwards!
```bash
cd z_framework
git checkout 0.11.0
```

### Mail Security
There is a new config setting called `mail_security`, which allows setting the transport security when sending mails. Until now, it has always been `tls`, which is why `tls` is the default value for this setting. No update to the configuration file i needed. If you i.e. use a local mailer, which requires a plain connection, you may set this setting to `false`. The following steps are recommended to migrate local test setup, which use environment variables to overwrite settings:

1. Set the value `mail_security` in the configuration file to `tls`.
1. Set the environment variable `CONFIG_MAIL_SECURITY` to `"false"`. (Include the `"`)

This way a production deployment does not need to overwrite this value, while allowing for local plain connections.

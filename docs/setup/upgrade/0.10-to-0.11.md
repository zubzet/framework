## Installation
### Repository URL
The repository URL has changed. ZubZet now made it to Github! To update your submodule, run the following command in the z_framework folder.

=== "SSH"
    Update to the new repo URL using SSH:
    ```bash
    git submodule set-url z_framework ssh://git@github.com:zubzet/framework.git
    ```
=== "HTTPS"
    Update to the new repo URL using HTTPS:
    ```bash
    git submodule set-url z_framework https://github.com/zubzet/framework.git
    ```

Be sure to checkout to 0.11.0 afterwards!
```bash
cd z_framework
git checkout 0.11.0
```

### Mail Security
There is a new config setting called `mail_security`, which allows setting the transport security when sending mails. Until now, it has always been `tls`, which is why `tls` is the default value for this setting. No update to the configuration file i needed. If you i.e. use a local mailer, which requires a plain connection, you may set this setting to `false`. The following steps are recommended to migrate local test setup, which use environment variables to overwrite settings:

1. Set the value `mail_security` in the configuration file to `tls`.
1. Set the environment variable `CONFIG_MAIL_SECURITY` to `"false"`. (Include the `"`)

This way a production deployment does not need to overwrite this value, while allowing for local plain connections.

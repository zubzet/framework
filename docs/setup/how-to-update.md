# Updating to the newest version of the framework
This page assumes you are using this framework as a git submodule .

1. Get the newest version of the submodule by using `git pull` in the `z_framework` directory.
2. Open the Z-Admin panel by opening the web page in your browser `yourwebsite.tld/[root/]z/` and log in.
3. Go to the `Framework Update` page.
4. Click `Update to framework version`.

When you reload the page and the project version is the same as the framework version, everything worked fine.
